-Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
-Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ... `. Always include complete code.
-Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
-Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
-Explain you OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.
-Break down monolithic files. Implement Modularization.
-Always start the project with comprehensive log management system with proper web log viewer, logging levels and log rotation.
-Default terminal profile is Git Bash. Use command that works in Git Bash.
-Never create files with prefixes like "_new,_fixed,_enhanced,_v1,_v2,_v3,_final,.new,.fixed,.enhanced,.v1,.v2,.v3,.final. Instead, edit the original file. If stuck at persistent edit tooli issue or permission issuem, stop and ask for help.
-If you are having issues editing a file. Create a new file, delete the old file and rename the new file using the name of the old file.
-Use TOML Technology for cofiguration files
-Use the files inside reference folder as reference for Together AI implementation.
-Use Together AI API key: 56c8eeff9971269d7a7e625ff88e8a83a34a556003a5c87c289ebe9a3d8a3d2c

General guidelines:
-Terminusa is a Crypto Tax Reporting System
--Problem: Traders struggle to manually track transactions across exchanges for tax purposes.
--Solution: Develop an AI tool that aggregates transaction histories, calculates gains/losses, and generates tax-ready reports. Use free APIs (e.g., CoinGecko) to fetch data and Together AI API for template generation.
-Create from scratch the admin panel/backend in admin folder. Use admin panel for user management, user subscription management, billing, reports, analytics, frontend settings and frontend style & design.
-Enhance the style & design of frontend
-Add registration and login functionality connected to backend (admin folder)
--User registration and profile must contain (must be recorded in backend):
---Username
---Password
---Complete Name
---Company Name
---Company Address
---Company Email
---Company Phone Number
---Company Logo

Do not touch the style and design
